Abstract* 
This paper evaluates how the global financial crisis emanating from the 
U.S. was transmitted to emerging markets. Our focus is on the extent that 
the crisis caused external market pressures (EMP), and whether the 
absorption of the shock was mainly through exchange rate depreciation or 
the loss of international reserves.  Controlling for variety of factors 
associated with EMP, we find clear evidence that emerging markets with 
higher total foreign liabilities, including short- and long-term debt, 
equities, FDI and derivative products?had greater exposure and were 
much more vulnerable to the financial crisis. Countries with large balance 
sheet exposure -- high external portfolio liabilities exceeding international 
reserves?absorbed the global shock by allowing greater exchange rate 
depreciation and comparatively less reserve loss. Despite the remarkable 
buildup of international reserves by emerging markets during the period 
prior to the financial crisis, countries relied primarily on exchange rate 
depreciation rather than reserve loss to absorb most of the exchange 
market pressure shock. This could reflect a deliberate choice (?fear of 
reserve loss? or competitive depreciations) or market actions that caused 
very rapid exchange rate adjustment, especially in emerging markets with 
open capital markets, overwhelming policy actions.

1.  Introduction  
 
International financial markets were at the heart of the world-wide financial crisis 
that emerged in late 2007 and reached a climax between August 2008 and February 
2009. Although the crisis started with mortgage-related (sub-prime) crisis in the 
United States, and was closely linked to banks in Western Europe holding mortgage-
backed securities and derivative products, it quickly led to global liquidity crisis that 
caused financial market turmoil through the rest of the world.  
 
We focus in this paper on the extent to which the global financial shock adversely 
affected the external position of emerging market economies. We measure external 
position by looking at changes in exchange market pressure?a combination of 
exchange market depreciation and loss of international reserves?as well as 
considering these two components separately. We are interesting in two basic 
questions: Firstly, how was the transmission of the global shock affected by the extent 
of their international balance sheet exposure, financial development and financial 
openness?1  Secondly, given the degree of exchange market pressure, what 
determines the tradeoff or choice between exchange rate depreciation and loss of 
international reserves in absorbing the shock? We sidestep in this paper questions 
regarding the root causes of the crisis.  These issues are covered by growing literature 
dealing with the pre-crisis trends and policies that led to the buildup of financial 
vulnerabilities, and ultimately to the crisis in the US and it rapid transition to the 
global economy [see Obstfeld (2010), Obstfeld and Rogoff (2010), and the references 
therein].   
 
Our main focus in on how the global financial crisis affected emerging market 
economies (EMs), where we define emerging market economies according to the 
Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Emerging Markets index (see Table 1,

notes for the list of EMs).  The focus on emerging markets stems from several 
observations.  First, these countries were the source of most of the pre-crisis 
economic growth, and most of the global population lives there.  Second, the process 
of globalization rapidly increased the financial and trade linkages of emerging 
markets with the OECD countries, relative to the more limited integration of 
developing, non emerging market countries.  Finally, the OECD countries have had 
elastic access to large dollar swap lines extended by the US FED (either directly or 
via FED?s large swap line with the ECB).  Thereby, the OECD countries were able to 
meet excess demand for dollar liquidity by borrowing dollar reserves from the FED, 
facilitating the adjustment and deleveraging pressures.  In contrast, most emerging 
markets were not able to rely on borrowed reserves via swap lines, and were thereby 
more exposed to the need to adjust abruptly to the global crisis. 
    
Our results highlight the importance of total external liabilities/GDP ratio 
(including debt, equity, FDI and derivative products) in accounting for exchange 
market pressures, and the short term external debt/international reserves ratio in 
accounting for the higher relative importance of exchange rate depreciation in 
accommodating the adjustment to a given degree of exchange market pressure.   Our 
findings also corroborate that there was a systematic variation in emerging markets 
exposure to EMP, and in the ways to accommodate these pressures.  
 
Section 2 overviews the response of emerging and developing economies to the 
global financial shock.  Section 3 applies multivariate regression analysis, explaining 
external vulnerability to financial shocks.  Section 4 explains the tradeoff between 
reserve loss and exchange rate depreciation, and Section 5 concludes.  
 
2. Response of Emerging and Developing Economies to the Global Financial Shock 
Appendix Table A1 presents the change in Exchange Market Pressure (EMP),2 
exchange rate depreciation and percentage loss of international reserves during the

pressure.   
height of the financial crisis, August 2008 ? February 2009, and during the worst 
phase of the crisis: September ?December 2008. The EMP measure is the sum of the 
percentage change in the exchange rate (positive values denote percentage 
depreciation) and percentage loss of reserves. High values denote greater external 
pressure.3  The two components of EMP, percentage change in the exchange rate 
(depreciation relative to the USD) and percentage in international reserves. 
  
It is remarkable how extreme and widespread across emerging markets were 
external pressures during August 2008 ? February 2009, ranging from highs 
experienced in Poland (108%) and Russia (89%) to negative values (a combination of 
a net appreciation and gain in international reserves) for countries such as Hong Kong 
(SAR), China, Israel, Jordan and Thailand. With the exception of Venezuela, all the 
emerging markets with positive EMP experienced substantial depreciation of their 
currencies against the USD during August 2008 ? February 2009.   Table A1 also 
shows the considerable heterogeneity in their response.  Poland depreciated the most, 
79%, while Brazil, Korea, Mexico and Russia depreciation by about 50%.  Reserves 
loss were more moderate, led by Russia, Poland and Malaysia (losing 37%, 28% and 
27%, respectively), followed by Venezuela, Morocco, India and Korea (23%, 21%, 
19%  and 19%, respectively).  
  
To put this into broader perspective, the average EMP for the full sample of all 
countries (independently of their income levels) was about 30%. Emerging markets 
and low income countries had average EMP of about 35%, while middle and high 
income countries had lower EMP rates at 28% and 32%, respectively. Emerging 
markets differ most from other country groups in the composition of exchange 
rate/reserve loss?emerging markets absorbed much less of the EMP by losing 
reserves (and experienced corresponding greater exchange rate depreciation).

 A second EMP measure is the sum of the percentage change in the exchange rate and loss of 
international reserves as a percentage of the monetary base. This measure focuses on the 
potential monetary effects of reserve losses during the financial crisis. This measure gave an 
almost identical ranking of external market pressure and is not reported for brevity.   
Specifically, the ratio of reserve loss to exchange rate depreciation is 0.32 while low 
income countries, with a similar EMP to emerging markets, had a ratio of 0.73. The 
ratio for the full sample is 0.45.  
 
The financial crisis also hit all regions of the world, though the greatest effect was 
felt in Eastern Europe/Central Asia (50% EMP). This is not surprising given that the 
sub-prime crisis emanated from the U.S. was directly linked to financial institutions 
in Western Europe, and Western Europe in turn was tightly linked through banking 
ties with the more fragile economies of Eastern Europe. By contrast, Africa/Middle 
East fared best as a region with the lowest EMP, with an average of only 20%, 
followed closely by Latin America with 23% EMP.  
 
Panel studies of EMP frequently normalize the exchange rate depreciation rate 
and reserve loss rate, focusing on the deviations from their means, normalized by the 
standard deviation of the relevant series (see Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2005)).  
As our focus is on a cross country comparison during an unprecedented global crisis, 
we refrain from such normalizations.  As a sensitivity analysis, we compare our EMP 
measure and the Weighted EMP used at the IMF?s World Economic Outlook (2009).  
The correlation between the two measures in highly significant at 0.63.  
    
In summary, the global financial crisis affected countries across the globe in all 
regions, income levels and whether or not they had tight restrictions on capital flows. 
Exchange market pressure was intense in most countries, mainly absorbed by 
exchange rate depreciation but also through substantial losses of international 
reserves.  
 
3. Explaining External Vulnerability to Financial Shocks 
 
Multivariate regression analysis of the link between EMP and selected 
explanatory variables in emerging markets is reported in Tables 1 and 2.  We define 
emerging market economies according to the Morgan Stanley Capital International 
(MSCI) Emerging Markets index, focusing on emerging markets that experienced 
positive EMP and were not the recipients of IMF standby agreements, subject to data 
availability [see Tables 1-2, notes for further details].  The dependent variable is the 
degree of exchange market pressure (EMP) during the height of the financial crisis, 
September 2008 ? December 2008 (table 1), and a wider 9-month window from July 
2008 through February 2009 (table 2). We are focusing on our two key measures of 
financial vulnerability: total external liabilities/GDP and balance sheet exposure 
(Short term external debt/IR -1). We also include a host of control variables common 
in the empirical literature on currency crises. The control variables are GDP per 
capita, measures of trade and financial openness, the extent of capital controls, the use 
of swap lines, OECD membership, the rise of the real exchange rate in the years prior 
to the crisis (2003-2007), and international reserves/GDP.4  Specific variable 
definitions and data sources are provided in the data appendix.  
 
[Tables 1-2 about here: regressions of EMP] 
 
We find that total external liabilities are significantly (at the 1% level) and 
positively related to exchange market pressure (EMP) and this result is robust to 
every model specification, for both the short and the longer sample period. Larger 
external liabilities?including short- and long-term debt, equity, FDI and derivative 
products-- made emerging markets more vulnerable to the global financial crisis.  
 
During the peak of the crisis, balance sheet exposure is also positively related to 
exchange market pressure, but is not significant at conventional levels.  OECD 
membership effect is positive and significant, raising the EMP, in line with the 
greater exposure of OECD countries to the US crisis.  Access to a swap line reduces 
the EMP, as it allows meeting deleveraging pressure by borrowing reserves. The

 These controls include the one used by Frankel and Saravelos (2010) in their study of EMP 
incidences during the crisis.  Other variables, not reported for brevity, were also used as 
control variables but were never significant. In particular, we included inflation rates, interest 
rates, monetary independence and alternative measures of capital controls.  
other variables investigated?capital account openness, trade openness?were not 
statistically significant different from zero.   Similar results hold for both the shorter 
and the longer crisis window, though the OECD dummy and the access to the swap 
lines lose their significance in the longer crisis window.     
 
4. The tradeoff between reserve loss and exchange rate depreciation 
 
We observed that countries differ markedly in their response to the financial crisis 
in terms of whether exchange rate depreciation or losses of reserves absorb EMP. Are 
there discernable patterns in the loss of international reserves relative to exchange rate 
depreciation in emerging markets for a given degree of exchange rate pressure during 
the global financial crisis? This is measured as the loss of international reserves as a 
percentage of total exchange market pressure. Large values indicate that countries are 
absorbing a high percentage of the total shock by selling international reserves.  
 
It is not clear a priori how emerging markets would respond, in terms of using 
exchange rates or reserves, in absorbing an EMP shock. It would seem to be related to 
balance sheet exposure. If emerging markets have a high degree of short-term 
external debt exposure, often denominated in foreign currency, then they may want to 
limit exchange rate depreciation that increases the real value of the foreign debt. This 
would suggest a positive relationship between balance sheet exposure and Reserve 
Loss Relative to EMP. On the other hand, balance sheet exposure by definition means 
that short-term external liabilities are not covered by holdings of international 
reserves. This makes countries more vulnerable to the global financial shock and less 
able to stem the external crisis by using international reserves that are relatively in 
short supply. This argues for a negative link between balance sheet exposure and 
Reserve Loss Relative to EMP.   
 
Tables 3 and 4 report the multivariate regression analysis of the link between IR 
loss rate/EMP and the explanatory variables applied in Tables 1 and 2 during the 
height of the financial crisis, September 2008 ? December 2008 (table 3), and a wider 
9-months window from July 2008 through February 2009 (Table 4).  Balance sheet 
exposure is significantly (in most cases at 5% level) and negatively associated with 
Reserve Loss Relative to EMP.  Countries with fewer reserves relative to short-term 
external portfolio debt rely more on exchange rate depreciation to absorb the EMP 
shock. Limited reserves constrain countries in how they respond to the crisis, as is 
consistent with the second hypothesis discussed above.5  By contrast, total external 
liabilities, trade openness, capital account liberalization and swap lines are not 
statistically significant. The commodity intensity of trade (commodity exports as a 
percentage of total exports) is positively associated with Reserve Loss Relative to 
EMP and is statistically significant at the 5% level at the peak of the crisis, the last 
quarter of 2008. It appears that emerging markets relying more on commodities in 
their export trade are more prone to use international reserves, and try to limit 
exchange rate depreciation, when faced with the global financial shock.    
 
[Tables 3-4 about here: regressions of IR loss rate/EMP] 
 
Countries with few reserves relative to portfolio debt are much more likely to rely 
on exchange rate depreciation than use scare reserves to absorb the global financial 
shock. By contrast, the extent of total external liabilities does not enter significantly 
(as it did in explaining overall EMP). This finding is an interesting contrast to the 
results in Tables 1 and 2, and suggests that the determinants of total vulnerability 
(EMP) are distinct from the factors that determine the tradeoff between using reserves 
or the exchange rate (Reserve Loss Relative to EMP).   
 
Figures 1 and 2 plot the conditional association between Reserve Loss Relative to 
EMP and balance sheet exposure for the two sample periods, showing the strong 
negative association between the two variables.  This association is more pronounced 
                                                           
5 The economic effect is quite large: a 10 percentage point higher pre-crisis balance sheet 
exposure (Sort term Debt in excess of IR) relative to IR, corresponds to up to 3.06 percentage 
points (3.87 percentage points) lower fraction of IR loss relative to EMP during the 4-month 
(the 9-months) crisis windows, respectively. 
during the peak of the crisis, a period when emerging market-commodity exporters 
relied more heavily than other EMs on reserves depletion to cushion their adjustment 
to EMP.

exposure] 
 
5. Conclusions 
  
We found clear evidence that emerging markets with higher ratio of the total 
foreign liabilities/GDP were more vulnerable to the financial crisis. Higher balance 
sheet exposure (higher short term foreign debt relative to international reserves) is 
significantly associated with greater weight attached to currency depreciation and 
lower weight attached to losing international reserves as means of dealing with 
exchange market pressure during the crisis. While larger total external liabilities/GDP 
are clearly associated with larger EMP, higher ratio of external short term 
debt/international reserves is associated with higher weight on price adjustment 
(exchange rate depreciation) and lower weight on quantity adjustment (losing 
reserves) as a way to accommodate a given EMP.   Despite the remarkable buildup of 
international reserves by emerging markets during the period prior to the financial 
crisis, emerging markets relied primarily on exchange rate depreciation rather than 
reserve loss to absorb most of the exchange market pressure shock??fear of reserve 
loss.? 
 
These findings are consistent with the observations in Aizenman and Yi (2010) 
regarding emerging markets? switch during the crisis from the fear of floating [Calvo 
and Reinhart (2001)] to the fear of losing reserves during the crisis.  While 
international reserves/GDP ratios were high in most emerging markets before the 
crisis relative to their levels in previous crises, they rarely were high enough to cover 
the entire external portfolio liabilities of the affected countries.  Thus, countries opted 
to rely on exchange rate adjustment, refraining from fast depletion of their 
international reserves.  The reluctance to rely more on reserves depletion may reflect 
several concerns: fear that losing reserves too fast may propagate a run on the 
remaining reserves, and uncertainty about crisis duration may suggests keeping 
reserves to deal with future market pressure. Furthermore, at times of collapsing 
global demand, countries are more willing to engage in competitive depreciation, as 
the downside of higher inflation is sharply mitigated by the global recession.  
Interestingly, we find that emerging markets relying more on commodities in their 
export trade are more prone to use international reserves, and try to limit exchange 
rate depreciation, when faced with the global financial shock.  This is consistent with 
the notion that commodities are priced by the global market, thus commodities 
exporters don?t benefit from depreciation, opting instead to use their reserves to 
absorb exchange market pressure.    
 
Our results are also in line with Frankel and Saravelos (2010), reporting several 
pre-crisis variables accounting for the 2008-09 crisis incidence.  Specifically, they 
found that higher pre-crisis reserves/GDP and lower pre-crisis real exchange 
appreciation were associated with lower exchange market pressure during the crisis.   
Yet, our results also suggest the importance of the ratio total external liabilities/GDP 
in accounting for higher exchange market pressure during the crisis. Controlling for 
this broad exposure measure renders balance sheet exposure insignificant. 
 
Our results corroborate the notion that globally linked national financial markets, 
intermediated via foreign currency markets, transmitted globally the 2008-9 financial 
crisis. In turbulent times, when the duration of depth of the global crisis remains 
unknown, emerging markets behavior has been characterized more by the fear of 
losing reserves, and less by the fear of floating.  Despite the remarkable buildup of 
international reserves by emerging markets during the period prior to the financial 
crisis, countries relied primarily on exchange rate depreciation rather than reserve loss 
to absorb most of the exchange market pressure shock. This could reflect a deliberate 
choice, possibly to gain competitiveness at times of collapsing export demand.  It 
may also reflect market actions that moved quickly and strongly to adjust to changing 
circumstances, especially in emerging markets with open capital markets.  The 
financial market crisis was followed by a global recession, suggesting that exchange 
rate depreciations attempting to improve international competitiveness can be part of 
the adjustment of small economies but can?t resolve global collapsing demands.  Our 
findings also confirm the key importance of balance sheet effects in explaining 
vulnerabilities and adjustments.  Countries with higher total foreign liabilities/GDP 
were more vulnerable to the financial crisis. Countries with larger balance sheet 
exposure ? higher external portfolio liabilities exceeding international reserves ? 
responded to the global shock by allowing greater exchange rate depreciation and 
comparatively less reserve loss.

We define emerging market economies according to the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Emerging Markets index. The index includes 26 countries: Argentina, 
Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Russia, 
South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and Venezuela. We exclude Hungary because it received its first substantial IMF disbursement of approximately $6.4 billion during our 
sample period significant affecting its foreign exchange reserve position and potentially the level of exchange rate depreciation. We also exclude Taiwan due to insufficient data. 
We construct our sample from the remaining emerging market economies which experienced positive EMP: 18 during the 4-month time window and 20 during the 9-months 
window. These are: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Russia, 
South Africa, Turkey and Venezuela.

positive EMP. 
We define emerging market economies according to the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Emerging Markets index. The index includes 26 countries: Argentina, 
Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Russia, 
South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and Venezuela. We exclude Hungary because it received its first substantial IMF disbursement of approximately $6.4 billion during our 
sample period significant affecting its foreign exchange reserve position and potentially the level of exchange rate depreciation. We also exclude Taiwan due to insufficient data. 
We construct our sample from the remaining emerging market economies which experienced positive EMP: 18 during the 4-month time window and 20 during the 9-months 
window. These are: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Russia, 
South Africa, Turkey and Venezuela.
